    <blockquote>
    <p>My name is Hou-Yi-Ling. I’m an nineteen-year-old student, studying in National Tainan Commercial Vocational Senior High School and my major is the International Trade Department. I was born on a special day, International Women's Day. I am an easygoing girl and always keep smile on my face. I grew up in a four-people family. My younger brother studies in junior high school. My father serves a maintenance man and my mother works as a dishes washer. Although they are very busy with their jobs, they never let my brother and I feel poor. My parents usually tell us not to worry about our daily and economical expenses. We can lead a happy life in a positive way. <strong> They educate us how to deal with people, how to face difficulties, and how to help others in need. </strong> Moreover, they never force me to do things what I don’t like. They give me freedom of choice. I really appreciate my parents. All of them play important roles in my life.

    <div class="bfont"><h3>School Life</h3></div>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I participated in the <strong> Track and Field team </strong> in my senior high school days. I was a good athlete and good at long-distance running. <strong> I came in first in 10,000-meter race </strong> and <strong> came in fifth in 5,000-meter race </strong>. As for me, <strong> practicing long-distance running can <em> make my heart get stronger </em> and <em> start delivering more oxygen to my body </em></strong>. Furthermore, while I was running, I could reduce all of my stress and depression. On the other hand, I took part in the <strong> Pop Dancing Club </strong>. It was an very interesting club. I learned a lot of new dancing skills and performed pretty well. That’s why I was involved in various dancing competitions. However, <strong> dancing not only made me energetic but also pleased </strong>. 
    </p><hr>
    I am a person of responsibility. That’s why <strong> I was elected class leader twice </strong>. I was good at communicating with classmates and dealt with some class chores. During the past three years, I have made my efforts to study hard. My favorite subjects are mathematics and computer science. At my teachers’ suggestions, I passed some professional certificates.<p></p>
